<b>techonly</b>

Invite-only Slack dedicated as a tech Q&amp;A site for experienced geeks.

This will probably be most useful for freelancers who need to do lots of new/esoteric things, or as a sounding board.

* We probably all have plenty of places to shoot the shit. The idea is to keep it focused on tech, and specifically on tech questions that the Internet fails to answer
* If this works out well/is useful, techonly might expand w/ a friend-of-friend/vetted invite model, but for now it'll be a bit small. Drop @lhl a line if you want to add someone
* Everything is FrienDA, but if it's something especially sensitive, let people know
* Lets see how fine-grained channels need to be...

MAYBE TODO:
* Invite form
  * recommended-by (current member)
  * profile - olb, twitter, site, comma delimited list of expertise
    * show existing, autocomplete for existing topics
* Bot
  * Q&amp;A stats
  * interactions - login, posting, etc
  * karma tracking
  * link logging/search?
